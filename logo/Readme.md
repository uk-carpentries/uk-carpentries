# uk-carpentries Logo

The Logo is derived from the [Carpentries logo](https://github.com/carpentries/logo) which goes by a CCO licence.

The [Union Jack flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg) comes from wikipedia and is in the public domain.

The Carpentries logo was traced using [affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/), a png version of the UK flag had its colour
saturation decreased using the mac preview application and then used as the background for the carpentry logo.

The uk-carpentries is released under a CC0 Licence.
