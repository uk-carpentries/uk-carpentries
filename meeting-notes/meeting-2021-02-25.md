# Meeting 25 February 2021

## About 

This is the UK Carpentry Community space:
- for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration
- to get the community's questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpentry workshop websites, registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry institutional membership or anything else 
- to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers
- to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for the community to share their experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.

During these meetings, we will be conforming to [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

**Regular calls: 4th Monday of the month, 16:00-17:00 UK time**

- House keeping 
    - Rolling notes - this document!
    - After each session, the notes will be stored in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/anenadic/local-uk/blob/main/meeting_minutes.md) (hopefully with a push of a button)
    - **Rotating roles - setting the agenda, chairing and notetaking**
    - Meetings will appear in the [Carpentries community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g@group.calendar.google.com)
    - This notes document is also linked from the top of the [Carpentries community discussion Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) 
- What do you personally / or the community as a whole want from these calls? So that it can help us with planning the themes of the future calls. (Make your suggestions here.)
    - e.g. workshop organisation - the process and what people need help with? 
    - look for lesson developers and maintainers [name=Phil Reed]
    - opportunities to instruct +2 [name=Flic Anderson](@gjblyth Graham Blyth)  Join the instructor mailing list here : https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors. New opportunities for instructors go out weekly :)
    - opportunities to join as helper +1 [name=Flic Anderson] (@gjblyth Graham Blyth)
    - cross connections between lessons?  Discussion on strategy perhaps.  It would be duplication of effort to rewrite lessons for each domain though.  Emphasising cross connections perhaps instead? [name=Joni Pelham] +1
      - looking for ways to have the domain selectable without changing the entire course would help. HPC Carpentry has (sort of) done this by allowing you to select which HPC system is being used and all the instructions update to be specific to that. [name=Colin Sauze]
      - some "modularity" of materials perhaps, so we can mix-and-match to organise workshops around a theme? [name=Hugo T]
    - Katerina: organise joint remote workshops? +1
    - Mario: et to know fellow members in the community, easier to populate courses with helpers/instructors if you know the faces. Something I would love to know is evaluating the efficacy of courses - get back to attendees later and ask them whether they went on to use what they learnt, any pitfalls they encountered or whether they were there because they were told to be or just for interest. +1Share best practice - what works/does not work. +1
    - +1 to above on evaluation, doing more about long term evaluation would be really useful to justify resources.
    - invite past learners to join regional community as helpers (and hopefully as instructors)     +2
    - chances to run/help with workshops at other universities. Especially while geography doesn't matter so much! +5 [name=Colin Sauze, Flic Anderson, ....]
    - Meet people around the UK who are involved in the Carpentries. Looking forward to organising workshops around the UK. If you want to volunteer as a helper or instructor, feel free to contact me. [name=Juan Herrera]
    - Keep up to date with what's happening in the community, who's working on what, who wants help with what, where the British Library can facilitate (especially Library Carpentry) [name=Jez Cope]
    - How to promote library carpentry? learning from other universities. How librarians can put learning into practise / day-to-day job facilitate (especially Library Carpentry) [name=Nilani Ganeshwaran]+1
    - Ideas for bridging carpentries and digital scholarship [name=Nilani Ganeshwaran] +1
    
- Q&A - what questions do you have?
    - Anyone interested in teaching the R class (13th of May) from the Lib Carp Curriculum? (lucia.michielin@ed.ac.uk)
    - Also looking for helpers for [Software Carpentry March 9-12](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/2021-03-09_UCL_software_carpentry/) at UCL! (remotely though) (a.georgoulas@ucl.ac.uk)
- Announcements
    - Subscribe to or check regularly the [Carpentries Blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/).
- Suggestions
    - Mario: Break up into smaller special interest groups who work on a task/topic on a voluntary task and report back at the next meeting.

* Sarah Rono adds and they are investigating ways to make that possible
* Lucia is looking for R instructors for the Library carpentry curricula.
* Kari encourages people to read or subscribe to the [blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/) ([rss](https://carpentries.org/feed.xml))
* Anastasis: Looking for helpers for a workshop in UCL
* Mario: suggestion: group is big, hard to manage, maybe form subgroups who can take some conversation offline and report back subsequently
* Regarding the time of future meetings beware of parenting duties
