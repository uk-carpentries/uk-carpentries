    - Joni: Like to go and watch the SpaceX Starship development
    - James: Middle of the lake district after COVID with directions to the nearest decent pub [name=Toby]: this sounds great too
    - Jez: Floating in a lake in the Lake District, probably Crummock Water or Grasmere (with some nice Grasmere gingerbread for after)

        - Also looking for volunteers to help organise a kick-off workshop

4. Guest speaker: Giacomo Peru from EdCarp (Edinburgh Carpentries community) + Q&A (20 minutes)
    -  a bit of history, how it all started
        -  it was helped by the fact that the SSI has a branch in Edinburgh and there was a lot of know-how available in the Institute
    -  website: https://edcarp.github.io/workshops/
    -  how you got the funds/effort initially
        -  no money initially, but there was the opportunity for Giacomo to put in 20-40% of his time to support Carpentries activities
        -  Sean McGeaver, School of Physics and Astronomy, UoE, put in some money in to pay the first membership with the Carpentries from his grant (the first year), then got other 3 colleges in Edinburgh to chip in
        -  set up one [Organising Committee and one Steering Committee](https://edcarp.github.io/committee/)
            -  Steering Committee meets twice per year, composed of people who (in theory) are able to commit funds and resources.
        -  Mario: uptake from different areas, effort from representives at different schools/faculties was vital to get it going. It began with interest in learning the skills taught in a Carpentries workshop, then became interested in becoming an Instructor.
            -  Lucia: volunteer-based model assumes Instructors will be staff who can dedicate time as part of their job. But often not the case, and e.g. PhD students can feel pressured to take on voluntary teaching responsibilities without potential for this effort to be rewarded.
    -  how are you funded now
        -  even now it is not easy to get agreement on supporting a membership
        -  we have been able to attract small pots of money to spend on specific projects (e.g. Scottish Funding Council last year for 7 workshops)
        -  EdCarp are also now part of a funded UKRI project to develop materials for bioinformatics training & deliver workshops
            -  also allows us to pay for maintenance and development of infrastructure e.g. website
    -  where are you based (which group within the Uni of Edinburgh)
    -  how many people are there in the community altogether, how many are involved in training
    -  are you a Carpentry partner and how do you find the money for that and how do you justify that to your funders,
    -  what are the terms of your Carpentry partnership?
    -  are you mainly self-sufficient now in terms of workshop organisations,
    -  how long it took EdCarp to become self-sufficient?
        -  not sure we are yet! even though there is huge interest and potential, we would not exist without leadership. Essential to have this dedicated leadership. 
            -  Aleks: :+1: in Manchester we see the services of members of the community are becoming over-subscribed and, without support from the top, they are going to struggle to keep doing this stuff voluntarily.
            -  Giacomo: it would be great to hear from anyone who has experience with convincing Universities etc to support these kinds of activity
    -  How does EdinCarp sit alongside any other university-wide bodies at Edinburgh? Do you have centralised IT, research support or library, or is that all contained within each of your three colleges? Do you stand on anyone's toes?
        -  There are central IT and Library services, but (some?) schools have their own IT too
        - Everybody at Edi is happy that EdCarp is doing what they are doing
        - EPCC is full of people who are full of people competent to teach these courses
        - In terms of competition - efforts to establish a local RSE group was not as successful as the EdCarp  
    - David PS: UCL: RSE team organises them. We try to find volunteers within "our community" for instructors and helpers. If not, the people from our team jumps in.
    -  Are other Edinburgh universities, ICMS (International Centre for Mathematical Sciences) and other organisations beyond the University of Edinburgh involved?
        -  yes. EdCarp is a collaboration between various institutions in the area, e.g. HWU, 
        -  no central support from any of the institutions - we have access to the resources of our respective institutes.
   - [x] Do you get many requests about more advanced material? If so, do you point them or run other workshops like [coderefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)? something else?
     - The SSI is organising something more advanced. Though Greg Wilson comments at CarpentryCon is that such gap should be covered by another type of training (e.g., University training)

6. Workshop organisation process go-through/recap + Q&A (15 minutes) (if there is time, if not - we will leave this for next time)
    - workshop slug/id
    - finding instructors/helpers
        - [instructor sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=266374636)
        - announce on [UK carpentry mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-uk) and [international instructor mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors)
    - can you pay the training team?
    - [register your workshop with The Carpentries](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/)
    - why is my workhop not listed at the Carpentries website
    - [Carpentries workshop FAQ](https://carpentries.org/workshop_faq/)
        - timeline - so you get workshop survey results on time
    
    **Question**: the most recent post in UK topic box for [carpentries workshop signups](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-uk/Tfece4de45672183f) links to a Google doc, all of the workshops are in the US. Is there a list of all the UK workshops? (Callum)
    - Have a look at the pages of the spreadsheet (tabs at the bottom) (Shashank) Thanks! Possily hang such a page off the existing Carpentry pages as opposed to reinventing the wheel.
    If the link were to the [UK tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=266374636) this could prevent confusion.
    
    **Question**: How many UK institutions are carpentries members? Has anybody got any examples of what it took to join/how it was funded or even examples of attempts which failed?
    - [Members of The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/members/)
        
7. AOB
- Comment on localised data for the UK from Malvika: Can the Carpentries member orgs maintain some sort of Git page that hosts these details (update workshop dates, and members etc.)?
    - Why would we need this? Help with impact and help institutions how to learn their memberships. 
    - Why would we need this? Help with impact and help institutions how to learn their memberships. 
    - Mario: Map of member institutions would be a nice idea
    - David PS: map of member institutions with a time slider, so you can see how they change ;)
        - Malvika: Collaboration Workshop Hack Day idea!
    - David PS: query the wikipedia to get the coordinates of the institution, pass it to open street map to visualise little classic building emojis on these. Don't forget the readme, license, howtocollaborate, and the CoC on the repo! and you've got a winning project ;)
