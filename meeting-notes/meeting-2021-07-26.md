# Meeting 26 July 2021

## About 

This is the UK Carpentry Community space:
- for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration
- to get the community's questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpentry workshop websites, registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry institutional membership or anything else 
- to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers
- to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for the community to share their experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.

### Notes

LC Survey

Library Carpentry (https://librarycarpentry.org/about/) focuses on building software and data skills within library and information-related communities.
Please forward this survey to a representative of the library at your institution, to allow us to learn more on if/how they are involved in The Carpentries and how we could better meet their training needs. More than one response per institution is welcome. This survey is not limited to Library Carpentry, we are interested in Software and Data Carpentry people too.
Please take 15 minutes (28 questions overall) for filling to the survey here: https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/zCkEJrkX
The deadline for participation is 31 July 2021. 

Change to Git Lesson - the use of SSH keys instead of passwords in now official in lessons (learners will be taken though the process of setting keys as part of the lesson)

From The Carpentries: The Carpentries would like to begin planning for in-person workshops. In order to provide the best solution we would like to hear from those involved to see how they are planning for future workshops for the period September-December 2021. Please take a few minutes to complete this brief survey to share your position on teaching/hosting in-person workshops. https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/I5dlZYlZ

Questions for Juan:

1. How do you enforce the "Save the Children" donations for no shows? (Love the idea!!!)
    - Not enforced, just email participants that have not showed up
    - Participants are notified that this will be asked of them in email reminders (also ask people to let the organisers know if they cannot attend)
    - ARCHER2 has a page with Just Giving for donations 
2. How many of the no shows pay the donation?
    - Not sure 
3. How useful do you think your own recordings are for the carpentries courses compared with lessons that are already available online? (Do people engage with them more?)
    - lessons are taught in different ways by different instructors and different questions are addressed at each course so there is a value in these recordings, especially for people who really wanted to attend but could 
    - A bit of post-processing of videos happen, remove some sensitive data e.g. from introduction, or silent part from breaks and exercises
4. Which video conferencing platform will you continue using going forward?
    - Blackboard Collaborate is good for teaching, for shorter webinars probably Zoom (in meeting mode), but also depends on that platform instructors feel comfortable with on the day
5. Do you feel that no shows rate is higher for online training/events?
    - Yes, for face-to-face traning people need to book time from their managers, make travel arrangements - which makes them less likely to miss training 
6. do you feel the appetite for face to face training is going to come back when the pandemic is behind us? Or is online training here to stay? 
    - Better support for f2f training and less elaborate support is needed. In the future - a mix of online and f2f.
7. Do you add captions to the videos?
    - Automatic captions added using YouTube's facilities. Used to do it manually but takes a few hours to do that.
8. Did they fixed the screen delay on Collaborate? last time we tried it was very hard to do Code training because every time you were scrolling down it took 1 sec or so to get back on focus for the attendees
    - Seems so.
