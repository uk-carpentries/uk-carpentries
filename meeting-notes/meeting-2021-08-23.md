# Meeting 23 August 2021

## About 

This is the UK Carpentry Community space:
- for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration
- to get the community's questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpentry workshop websites, registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry institutional membership or anything else 
- to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers
- to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for the community to share their experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.

## Announcments
- Mario: Edinburgh curriculum about to begin. Teaching virtual still.

  - Sher! looking at feedback for hybrid events, difficult to find best way to implement them effectively. The ones who are online feel disconnected from those in the room. 
  - Use of OWL cameras. https://uk-shop.owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-pro
  - Alycia: There is an upcoming workshop (September 14) on hybrid events being offered by the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement: https://www.cscce.org/cscce-webinar-series-virtual-events/
- Use of masks still being encouraged in face-to-face teaching.
- Differences between institutions whether sessions should be mostly physical or mostly virtual. 

## Git lesson updates
- Merged changes are ready now for Git which requires SSH keys (keys rather than tokens). Both Software Carpentry and Library Carpentry lessons.
- Has anyone taught with it yet?
- Windows PowerShell can pick up keys.

## Virtual RSE conference in SeptemberSE
https://septembrse.society-rse.org/registration/
Two events per day. Looking for volunteers. 

## Actions
- Lucia and Mario to look at using OWL camera for one of these meetings as a demonstration. Suggest October.
- Mario and any others: If you teach the updated Git lesson with SSH, bring your feedback to this group next month.
