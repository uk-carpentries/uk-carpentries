### Notes

#### Carpentries Lesson Development Programme
**[Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training) is a new program being piloted by The Carpentries to teach the skills required to collaboratively create open source lessons** using the Carpentries lesson infrastructure. The training will focus on three main topics:

- Good practice in lesson design
- Creating lesson websites with The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
- Collaboration skills

This is a follow-up to the "book club" style round of study groups that the SSI was helping The Carpentries run in 2021 - which was the first attempt to support collaborative lesson development in the community - and is an attempt to develop a training programme similar to the Instructor Training. 

As part of the programme [two pilot workshops](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/pilot-description.html) will be run to train people in lesson development pedagogy (between March - September 2022) and after that (later in autumn 2022) the first trainer cohort will be trained for scaled-up delivery of the programme in the future.

#### Carpentries Workbench - new lesson infrastructure
**[Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/01/live-lesson-infrastructure/) is the new lesson infrastructure** developed by the Carpentries to clearly separate the tools used to develop the lesson from its content. 

It uses pandoc and 3 custom R packages and provides 2 tempates - Markdown and RMarkdown. It should also provide for easier lesson translation and localisation.

Beta release in April 2022.

#### SSI's Research Software Camp (RSC) #3
**[RSC #3](https://www.software.ac.uk/RSCamp-next-steps-coding) - 16-27 May 2022, is themed around training and called "Next steps in coding"**, and will focus on:

- improving coding skills (for novice and intermediate learners)
- improving teaching, training and lesson development skills
- mentorship

Mixed content throughout the two weeks:
- Live sessions - workshops, talks/panels + discussions/Q&A
- Pre-recorded content, guides and blogs
- Mentorship programme and a Software Surgery

Look out for the call for workshops, Software Surgery doctors and mentors.

#### Show/share and tell
- What are people working on now?
- Projects seeking support/collaboration?
- Events you are planning on attending?


Actions
* Aleks to talk to Toby Hodges about publishing current lesson development proposals so that people can join existing ones to form groups
