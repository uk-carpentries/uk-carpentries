### Notes

#### Round robin of news and updates

* Announcement: [CarpentryCon 2022 @ Home](https://2022.carpentrycon.org/) is coming up. There is a session from Library Carpentry curriculumn advisory group 
with Cody Hennesy (University of Minnesota) and Phil Reed (University of Manchester) 
on 4 August at 5pm-6.30pm BST. We are looking at setting up buddies between the curriculum advisory groups.
Details to follow.

* Olexandr Konovalov: initiated Ukrainian translation of the SWC novice gapminder lesson at https://www.transifex.com/carpentries-i18n/python-novice-gapminder/

   - Olexandr: "We invite translators and reviewers - if you know anyone interested, please connect them with me or just suggest to get an account in transifex and request joining the team: https://www.transifex.com/carpentries-i18n/public/. A reviewer may be someone who knows Ukrainian and the lesson content, and will approve translations. They may also help to translate or just review what others wrote. So even a little amount of time dedicated to this will be helpful."

   - Could request a grant from SSI, perhaps.
   - Speak to [SUCHO](https://www.sucho.org/) "Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online" who have a network of people scraping websites of libraries, museums, galleries and related humanities projects and institutions. They have an active Slack channel who could help you to find translators of Software Carpentry lessons.

* Aleksandra Nenadic: Pilot #1 of the new [Collaborative Lesson development course](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/) 2 weeks ago (part 1 finished, part 2 is in July after learners pilot their individual lessons)


* From Andrew Stewart (SSI Fellow) via Aleks Nenadic: 
  > Lisa DeBruine at the University of Glasgow is running a code check survey on people's experiences with reviewing research code 
  > (which could be as a collaborator/teacher/reviewer etc). This is any 
  > code that is used to run experiments, create materials, process data, or 
  > analyze data. The aim of the survey is to gather responses that can be 
  > used to plan an introductory guide (for researchers with little or no 
  > formal training in coding) to code check - you can also sign up to 
  > contribute to writing this guide if you're interested. The survey itself 
  > is here if you'd like to complete it:

- [x] **Action**: Eirini to replace link with survey [done]

- [ ] **Action**: All to look at and then share the survey on code checks


* Mario Antonioletti volunteered as an instructor for a software carpentry at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute taking place next week. He appears to be the only UK-based instructor.
   - The group noted how calls for instructors seems to come more from non-academic institutions. The curriculum/syllabus required is often different to what most instructors know.
   - The group talked about the differnece between commercial and non-commercial firms arranging training, and the charges. 


* N8, eight northern English universities group, a group from Manchester (includes Nilani Ganeshwaran SSI fellowship and Phil Reed) are looking to run a new series of Library Carpentry sessions and to build on that existing network. Hoping to launch in November. 

#### Instructor Training checkout questions

Discussion of setting up network in Northern Ireland.
* Watch/help at other people's courses first. 
* See [Edinburgh Carpentries](https://edcarp.github.io/) example.
* Jump onto existing event like Love Data Week.

Discussion of what the Carpentries is all about. 
* Go to the [Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/
) as a starting point.
* [UK Carpentries](https://github.com/uk-carpentries
